‚ùó NOTE: If you look in `package.json` you'll see that `npm start` is actually just an alias for `nodemon index.ts`. Using the [nodemon tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) means you don't have to stop and start the application every time you change the code. Nodemon will automatically spot when files have changed and restart your application. 

If you ever need to actually stop your application you can press the key combination `Ctrl + C` to interrupt and kill the application.
